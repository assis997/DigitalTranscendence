        <p>Digital Transcendence is an interactive website and installation that translates the overwhelming yet embedded relationship we have with mass visual consumption. An addictive, borderless and frightening physiological and emotional phenomena we’ve somehow learned to accept and embrace, as an alternative to being paralyzed by its scale and impact. The website’s audiovisual aspects aim to induce sensorial feelings of acceleration, blurring the lines between the different social media content. The work immerses the viewer in a ‘wallpaper’ of mass media to heighten the physical and psychological experience. A repetitive techno beat is overlaid with an auditory illusion of infinite ascension known as the Shepard’s tone , the latter also translated to the video's speed. These combined effects symbolize the lack of gratification we get as we’re endlessly scrolling, hoping for closure. The only way to escape from the overwhelming experience seems to be closing the tab. As long as it’s open, you’re overtaken by a digital transcendence.</p>
        <p>The goal of this work is to induce a reflection on our relationship with social media and hyper-connectivity. Its poignancy lies in the common effects social media has on the human psyche.  The work highlights the rising issues of psychological and physiological overwhelm that come with the digital age of information which are heightened by the current Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical crises.</p>
